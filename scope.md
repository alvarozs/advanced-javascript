## Scope

Scope means where to look for things (the set of rules that helps us figure out where stuff is found)

Scope is a compiletime process.

The program goes through a compile step and it is at the compile step that all the scope decisions will happen.  
We like to think of it as a runtime thing but it is not that way.  
Refer to [Javascript is a compiled language](javascript-is-a-compiled-language.md).
