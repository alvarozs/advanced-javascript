# Advanced Javascript (from my point of view)

In this markdown I am going to be throwing interesting information about Javascript that I have experienced / read.

So, first of all something __very important__ is that the web console, node etc. are JavaScript-like. They are not behaving as the core Javascript spec expects. The only way to do that is to write Javascript on an empty file and run it on the browser!
